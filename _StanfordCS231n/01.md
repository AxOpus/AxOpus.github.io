## Background
This is primarily a course on computer vision. Why? Cameras, videos, explosion in number of sensors. Around 80% of data on the internet is video.

Computer Vision (CV) is a key part of a huge number of areas. Touching on neuroscience, biology, and NLP.

History of vision in biological evolution. In humans, vision accounts for ~60% of the neurons in the brain. Recall from CCN the orientation of bars. Different neurons build up the complexity from simple 'features'. AI research in this area has been around since the 1960s. (e.g. The summer vision project).

Object recognition is very difficult. Image segmentation is one technique, as is face-recognition.

## Course overview
Focuses on image classification. To do this we'll use additional methods such as object detection, action classification, and image captioning.

The main focus will be on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). These have been around since the 1990s, but have exploded in recent years due to advances in compute power and data.

The 'holy grail' of image recognition is trying to deeply understand an image, i.e. _what_ is going on in the image, and _why_ it is happening.
