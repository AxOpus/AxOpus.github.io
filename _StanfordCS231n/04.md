## Computational graphs
The key idea in a neural network is to think of it as a computational graph, in which there are computational nodes that perform actions (e.g. multiply, add, etc), into which data flows in and out.

#### Backpropagation

The gradients in the network are computed by a procedure known as backpropagation (backprop) which uses a recursive application of the chain rule moving from right to left in the graph.

This propagates the derivatives through the graph, so we can see how small changes in the inputs affect the loss.
