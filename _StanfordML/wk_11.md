## Photo OCR
This is an example of how an ML application would be built, either by us, or a team of developers, and showing how resources should be allocated.

#### Pipeline
1. Text detection
2. Character segmentation
3. Character classification

#### Windows
We'll use sliding windows to try and identify words. These are a rectangle which 'slide' across the image, and classify whether a word exists or not.

## Getting data
#### Artificial data synthesis
Comes in two forms: new data; or augmenting existing data. A good test is to work out how long it will take to get 10x as much data.

## Ceiling analysis
What to work on in the pipeline? Ceiling analysis looks at each part of the pipeline and simulates perfect output. We then look at the total pipeline accuracy with this improvement. We repeat this, moving downstream in the pipeline. This will give us the maximum percentage improvement of each stage and can be used to allocate resources.
