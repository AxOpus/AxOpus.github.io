## Overview
This is a curated list of Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) resources. There is a huge amount of information available, but this is collection of some books, courses, blogs to start.

## Starter materials
**[Andrew Ng's Coursera Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) (2011)** A solid foundational course in ML. Covers supervised and unsupervised learning in a fairly simple manner, so you don't get too bogged down in the maths. Although the field has advanced significantly since, particularly in deep learning, the principles remain. It uses Octave (or Matlab), which is useful if you only know python.

**[CS229-MachineLearning](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/CS229/) (2008)** The course which Andrew Ng teaches at Stanford. Covers similar material to the above course, but with more maths. These course materials and lectures are from 2008, but you can find the most recent notes [here](http://cs229.stanford.edu).

**[Udacity - Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120) (2016)** Taught by [Sebastian Thrun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebastian_Thrun) and [Katie Malone](http://blog.udacity.com/2016/04/women-in-machine-learning-katie-malone.html), this covers some slightly different material than the Andrew Ng course, with more focus on data science.

## Background Programming

## Background Mathematics
A large portion of machine learning relies on three main branches of maths: linear algebra; probability and statistics; and calculus.

#### Linear Algebra
**[MIT - Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/index.htm) (2011)** A complete introduction to linear algebra, with lecture videos and recitations.

**[Essence of Linear Algebra](https://youtu.be/kjBOesZCoqc) (2016)** A beautiful collection of videos introducing linear algebra. They visualise the matrix transformations in a way not possible in textbooks. 

#### Probability

**[MIT - Probabilistic Systems and Applied Probability](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-041sc-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2013/) (2013)** A relatively intense course covering probabilistic modelling. 

#### Calculus

**[MIT - Single Variable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/) (2013)**

**[MIT - Multivariable Calculus](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/) (2013)** The two sequence calculus programme offered by MIT.

## Books

**[Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning (Bishop)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pattern-Recognition-Learning-Information-Statistics/dp/0387310738) (2007)** Covers all the key foundations of ML in some depth. Quite mathematical.

**[Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Machine-Learning-Probabilistic-Perspective-Computation/dp/0262018020/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_t_1?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=B586DMKGVCMJ80X4AAHY) (2012)** Similar scope to Bishop, with some alternative presentations.

**[Elements of Statistical Learning (Hastie, Tibshirani, Friedman)](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/Papers/ESLII.pdf) (2009)** 

**[Deep Learning (Goodfellow, Bengio)](http://www.deeplearningbook.org) (2016)**

**[Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning (Barber)](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/textbook/090310.pdf) (2012)** 

**[Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton, Barto)](http://incompleteideas.net/sutton/book/bookdraft2016sep.pdf) (2016)** The definitive book on Reinforcement Learning (RL).

**[Information Theory, Inference, and Learning Algorithms(MacKay)](http://www.inference.org.uk/mackay/itila/book.html) (2005)** Very useful information on a variety of topics, especially sampling.

**[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu) (2016)** 

**[Computer Age Statistical Inference](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI_files/PDF/casi.pdf?utm_content=buffercb64f&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer) (2017)**

**[Neural Networks and Deep Learning (Michael Nielsen)](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) (2017)**

## Deep Learning
Deep learning (neural networks) is the topic of the moment, and there are significant resources available online for self-study.

**[Udacity - Deep Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning--ud730) (2016)**

**[Kadenze - Creative Applications of Deep Learning with TensorFlow](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/creative-applications-of-deep-learning-with-tensorflow/info) (2016)**

**[Stanford - Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.github.io) (2017)**

**[Stanford - TensorFlow for Deep Learning Research](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs20si/syllabus.html) (2017)** This is focused on TensorFlow, and is a nice start if you haven't used it before. 

## Reinforcement Learning
**[Stanford - Reinforcement Learning](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/syllabus.html) (2017)**

**[Udacity - Reinforcement Learning](https://www.udacity.com/course/reinforcement-learning--ud600) (2016)**

**[UCL - Course on RL](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html) (2015)** David Silver's (Google DeepMind) course on RL. Slides and videos.
